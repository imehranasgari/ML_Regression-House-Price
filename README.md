# House Price Prediction

## 🧩 Problem Statement and Goal of Project

The project aims to build a predictive model for estimating house prices based on various features such as lot area, year built, square footage, and other property characteristics. The goal is to apply machine learning to predict the sale price of residential homes.

## ⚙️ Solution Approach

The notebook follows a typical machine learning pipeline:

* Data import and initial exploration
* Handling missing values
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature engineering and encoding
* Model training using **Linear Regression**
* Evaluation using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

## 🛠 Technologies & Libraries

The project uses the following Python libraries:

* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `sklearn` (LinearRegression, train\_test\_split, StandardScaler, etc.)

## 🚀 Installation & Execution Guide

> However, this notebook is designed to be run in a Jupyter environment. To execute:
>
> 1. Install required libraries using `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`
> 2. Open the notebook using Jupyter:
>    `jupyter notebook 05_House-Price-Prediction.ipynb`

## 📊 Key Results / Performance

* Model used: **Linear Regression**
* Evaluation Metric: **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
* Specific performance score (numerical): **Not explicitly printed or stored in the notebook output**

## 🖼 Screenshots / Sample Outputs

* Multiple data visualizations showing correlation matrices, distribution plots, and feature relationships using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
* A residual plot and histogram of predictions versus actual values are displayed at the end.
